## About
A technical simulation exploring Craig Reynolds' 'Boids' algorithm to replicate organic group movement. Unlike standard pathfinding, this project implements raw **Vector Math** to calculate steering forces. I engineered a **Composite Behavior** System that blends three core rules: **Alignment, Cohesion, and Separation (Avoidance)**, resulting in fluid, lifelike swarm patterns.

## How to Run:
**Option 1: Play Build**
1.  Download & extract `Flocking Game.zip` (Located in root folder/Releases).
2.  Open `Flocking Game.exe`.

**Option 2: Open Source Code**
1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Open project in **Unity 2021.3.14f1**.
3.  Open Scene: `Scenes/MainSample`.
